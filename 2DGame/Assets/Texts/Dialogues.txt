carraigeFix2@See, I was bringing these wooden planks fer a merchant here.
carraigeFix3@Horace, that’s his name. Fine man, he; payin’ me good money. \\n Helps provide fer me family.
carraigeFix4@So anyway, I was travellin’ though the woods, and I saw a fluffy little rabbit.
carraigeFix5@It was pure white, as if it were from heaven! I saw it as a good sign,
carraigeFix6@so I stopped and tried to catch it, thinkin’ maybe I could sell it when I reached the town.
carraigeFix7@Have ya tried catching a rabbit before? I must tell ya, rabbits aren’t easy to catch.\\nIncredibly fast, those adorable monsters.
carraigeFix8@I spent the whole day just chasin’ it. It was hard work. \\n Eventually stopped to question whether it was worth it, but then
carraigeFix9@I figured: “I’ve come this far. Why turn back now?” \\n So I kept on chasin’ it.
carraigeFix10@Ya ever tried catchin’ rabbit before? It’s a lot harder than it looks! \\n I spent the whole day just tryin’ to catch it!
carraigeFix11@In the end I just gave up, and walked back to me carriage,
carraigeFix12@but by then it was gettin’ dark, so I made meself a torch.
carraigeFix13@This torch!
carraigeFix14@GUY: I gotta go now, wish you luck on your journy to rescue the princess

1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O152@PLAYER: When you flee, I request that you take me with you.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O153@I, too, have nothing keeping me in this wretched kingdom.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O154@I don’t want to return to my miserable farm.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O155@PRINCES: A companion does sound like a good idea.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O156@I accept your request. You may come with me.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O157@Wait here until I return.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O252@PLAYER: You cannot give up on your father.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O253@I am sure he loves you.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O254@As King, he is very busy.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O255@You should forgive him, and give him another chance.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O256@PRINCESS: Stop. I will hear no more from you.
1DemonKingBeach22O135O251O257@I will do what I want. That is none of your business.
1DemonKingBeach22O223@PLAYER: No.
1DemonKingBeach22O224@PRINCESS: Wow. That’s noble of you.
1DemonKingBeach22O225@Well then I guess you won’t get your money.
1DemonKingBeach22O226@There was no “Demon King” to save me from in the first place.
1DemonKingBeach22O227@PLAYER: What do you mean?
1DemonKingBeach22O228@PRINCESS: There was no Demon King.
1DemonKingBeach22O229@I staged my own kidnapping, and set everything up
1DemonKingBeach22O230@For my father.
1DemonKingBeach22O231@I wanted him to understand how I feel.
1DemonKingBeach22O232@But he didn’t come.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O@Instead, I got an idiot like you.*sigh*|[comforting]|[silent]
1DemonKingBeach22O233O134@PLAYER: I'm sorry.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O135@PRINCESS: ...

1DemonKingBeach22O233O139@PRINCESS: I just feel like he doesn’t care about me.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O140@He doesn’t talk to me,
1DemonKingBeach22O233O141@He sometimes doesn’t even look at me.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O142@PLAYER: My father is the same.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O143@I have been sending letters to him,
1DemonKingBeach22O233O144@but he never writes back.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O145@It’s as if he doesn’t know I exist.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O146@PRINCESS: So it seems.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O147@PLAYER: So, what will you do now?
1DemonKingBeach22O233O148@PRINCESS: I will send a message to my father.
1DemonKingBeach22O233O149@And then… I will sail into the wide sea,
1DemonKingBeach22O233O150@Never to behold my father’s face again.

EndingOne1@KING: Oh! How I truly miss my dear daughter!
EndingOne2@She was gone only yesterday, but now…
EndingOne3@It feels as though an eternity has passed.
EndingOne4@DEMON: Your Majesty.
EndingOne5@KING: You wretched fiend!
EndingOne6@DEMON: Me, the fiend? It is you who is the fiend.
EndingOne7@You have done nothing but sit on your throne,
EndingOne8@Awaiting the sun’s ascent and descent,
EndingOne9@Searching for meaning within the gold plates,
EndingOne10@Oblivious to the woes of the one,
EndingOne11@Whom you claim to love with all of your heart.
EndingOne12@Was it not you who once lectured
EndingOne13@That the Truth was of highest virtue?
EndingOne14@Are you not a liar, if you have pledged
EndingOne15@To love one with every ounce of your soul,
EndingOne16@Only to abandon it soon after?
EndingOne17@Is not a liar worthy of penance?
EndingOne18@In sooth, t’was not I who kidnapped your child;
EndingOne19@It was she who left on her own accord.
EndingOne20@And you are never to see her again,
EndingOne21@For she has fled into the open seas,
EndingOne22@Away from this land, and away from you.
EndingOne23@You will carry out the rest of your life
EndingOne24@Without the presence of she whom you failed.
EndingOne25@That is your penance. And a worthy one.
EndingOne26@KING: No words can aptly express my sorrows,
EndingOne27@The great, intense volumes of my remorse,
EndingOne28@The pain that I feel cannot be measured,
EndingOne29@Just as the number of stars in the sky
EndingOne30@Cannot be counted; it is infinite.
EndingOne31@By this sorrow, I beg you, take my life,
EndingOne32@For a life lived without my dearest child
EndingOne33@Is a life akin to a rotten fruit.
EndingOne34@I have chosen death to be my penance.
EndingOne35@PRINCESS/DEMON: Father.
EndingOne36@KING: My Abobberlisarinabella!
EndingOne37@PRINCESS: Don’t come closer!
EndingOne38@…
EndingOne39@I will be leaving.
EndingOne40@Please don’t come after me.
EndingOne41@KING: My dearest, believe me, I will repent!
EndingOne42@I will kneel before you and beg forgiveness!
EndingOne43@My dearest, you have shown me my errors.
EndingOne44@I will correct them, I promise, I swear!
EndingOne45@Please, please, please, do not leave me here alone,
EndingOne46@As your mother did all those years ago.
EndingOne47@I…  I… I will--
EndingOne48@PRICNESS: Father, I love you.
EndingOne49@KING: NOOOO!
EndingOne50@NO! NO! NO!
EndingOne51@…
EndingOne52@No…

EndingTwo1@KING: Oh! How I truly miss my dear Abobberlisarinabella!
EndingTwo2@She was gone only yesterday, but now…
EndingTwo3@It feels as though an eternity has passed.
EndingTwo4@Good Lord! My dearest, you have returned!
EndingTwo5@PRINCESS: I’m sorry, father.
EndingTwo6@KING: What for must you apologise, my dear?
EndingTwo7@PRINCESS: …
EndingTwo8@Nothing… I suppose.
EndingTwo9@KING: Indeed, nothing!
EndingTwo10@I am so glad that you’ve returned.
EndingTwo11@Come! I’ll have the servants prepare a meal.
EndingTwo12@Then you’ll tell me who it was who saved you.
EndingTwo13@PRINCESS: Oh no…
EndingTwo14@What hell have I willingly stepped into?
