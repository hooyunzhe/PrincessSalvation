carraigeFix2@See, I was bringing these wooden planks fer a merchant here.
carraigeFix3@Horace, that’s his name. Fine man, he; payin’ me good money. \\n Helps provide fer me family.
carraigeFix4@So anyway, I was travellin’ though the woods, and I saw a fluffy little rabbit.
carraigeFix5@It was pure white, as if it were from heaven! I saw it as a good sign,
carraigeFix6@so I stopped and tried to catch it, thinkin’ maybe I could sell it when I reached the town.
carraigeFix7@Have ya tried catching a rabbit before? I must tell ya, rabbits aren’t easy to catch.\\nIncredibly fast, those adorable monsters.
carraigeFix8@I spent the whole day just chasin’ it. It was hard work. \\n Eventually stopped to question whether it was worth it, but then
carraigeFix9@I figured: “I’ve come this far. Why turn back now?” \\n So I kept on chasin’ it.
carraigeFix10@Ya ever tried catchin’ rabbit before? It’s a lot harder than it looks! \\n I spent the whole day just tryin’ to catch it!
carraigeFix11@In the end I just gave up, and walked back to me carriage,
carraigeFix12@but by then it was gettin’ dark, so I made meself a torch.
carraigeFix13@This torch!
carraigeFix14@GUY: I gotta go now, wish you luck on your journy to rescue the princess

1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O152@PRINCES: A companion does sound like a good idea.
1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O153@I accept your request. You may come with me.
1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O154@Wait here until I return.
1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O249@PLAYER: You cannot give up on your father.
1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O250@I am sure he loves you.
1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O251@As King, he is very busy.
1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O252@You should forgive him, and give him another chance.
1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O253@PRINCESS: Stop. I will hear no more from you.
1DemonKingBeach22O232O248O254@I will do what I want. That is none of your business.
