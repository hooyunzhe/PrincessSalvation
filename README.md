When the King arrived at the Princess's Chamber to check on her, he saw nothing but ruin and chaos.
Without warning, the Demon King, who abducted her royal highness, appeared out of nowhere and demanded:

_I want that which is impossible,
whether by hand or mind, to be obtained.
On the hand between the sea and the shore,
therein lies the rotting head of a boar.
Seize it! And then bring it to me
by the summer solstice, I'll be waiting._

One day, the farmer went to town to get food for himself and his only boar.
When he saw the bounty for fifty thousand pounds of pure gold, he hesitated. After all, he was only a farmer.
However, he longed for his father's return, he wanted to make him proud.
Will you, the miserable farmer, successfully save the Princess and turn things around?
